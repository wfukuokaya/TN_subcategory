# Association of a stage III substaging with outcomes of radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer

This repository contains the R code used in the study "Association of a stage III substaging with outcomes of radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer".

The American Joint Committee on Cancer's Tumor-Node-Metastasis staging system has been a longstanding method for categorizing the severity of tumor invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis in malignant tumors. The eighth edition of the TNM staging classification introduced new subgroups IIIA (T3-4aN0M0 or T1-4aN1M0) and IIIB (T1-4aN2-3M0) in stage III, but there is limited evidence supporting the prognostic accuracy of this updated sub-staging. This study seeks to assess the prognostic significance of the revised stage III sub-staging system in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy.
